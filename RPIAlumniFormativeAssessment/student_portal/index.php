<h2>Welcome to The Student Portal</h2>
<hr>
<p>An alumni student, or alumnus/alumna, is an individual who has attended or graduated from a particular school, college, or university. These individuals form a vital, lifelong community that extends far beyond their time on campus, often staying connected through formal associations to foster networking, mentorship, and professional opportunities. Beyond social connections, alumni play a crucial role in supporting their alma mater by providing financial donations, acting as brand ambassadors, contributing to curriculum development, and offering real-world experience to current students through internships and career guidance. The term itself is derived from Latin, meaning "nurslings" or "foster children," symbolizing their enduring, nurtured relationship with the institution. Ultimately, the engagement of alumni is considered the backbone of higher learning institutions, helping to bridge the gap between academic education and professional, real-world success. </p>
