<h2>Welcome to The Student Portal</h2>
<hr>
<p>An IT alumni student is a graduate from an Information Technology program who maintains a lasting,, valuable connection with their alma mater, often acting as a bridge between academic learning and industry application. These professionals often possess strong technical, analytical, and problem-solving skills developed during their studies, which they apply in diverse fields such as software engineering, cybersecurity, or data analysis. As active members of an alumni network, they play a crucial role by providing mentorship, networking opportunities, and career advice to current students, frequently returning to campus for guest lectures, workshops, or to participate in career fairs. By fostering this, they help bridge the gap between classroom knowledge and the fast-evolving demands of the technology sector, while their own career successes—such as working in leading tech companies or driving innovation—elevate their institution’s reputation. Ultimately, IT alumni contribute to a thriving community, enabling the transfer of knowledge and experience from one generation of professionals to the next. </p>
